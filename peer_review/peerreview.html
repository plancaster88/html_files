    <strong class="text-secondary">This document will give an overview of why and how to have a peer review process in place for analytics teams.</strong>
    
    <br><br>
    <h5><u>Why have a peer review process?</u></h5>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>  
                    It gives all individuals involved in peer review an opportunity to see what other peers are working
                    on along with their methods for acquiring, transforming, analyzing, and presenting data.  
                </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick up new coding/tech specific tips and tricks</li>
                <li>Learn where peers are SMEs</li>
                <li>Allows us to answer why numbers are different for similar projects</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>  
                    It gives us an opportunity to identify potential data errors/discrepancies/mistakes in a project.
                </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data coming from our departments will have a greater chance of being correct. - obvious but important!</li>
                    <li>There is a potential that individuals may put more effort into verifying their work if they know others 
                        will be peer reviewing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <strong>  
                        Others may have suggestions for improvement.
                    </strong>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <br>
    <h5><u>Steps for peer review.</u></h5>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify if a task/project needs to go through the peer review process</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably - If you are writing new code with new logic.</li>
                    <li>Probably - If you are sending an analysis to someone to support an operation or decision.</li>
                    <li>Probably - Feeling like a 2nd set of eyes could help.</li>
                    <li>Probably Not - A routine process that already went through peer review 
                        (unless there is logic or structure change)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Identify who needs to peer review and send your work/output/code with notes on request specifics.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Managers usually only need to be included for crucial projects that they are responsible for.</li>
                    <li>Notes should be a quick summary.</li>
                    <li>Indicate how soon you need the peer review to be complete.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Implement necessary changes identified in peer review.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Correct data errors</li>
                    <li>Suggestions for change can be made at your discretion. <b>Note:</b> Many times,
                        suggestions from others are personal preference and do not necessitate an update.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h5><u>For peer reviewers.</u></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the time there will only need to be 1 person peer reviewing (unless it is a crucial project).</li>
                <li>Only offer to peer review if you can complete the peer review in the requested time.</li>
                <li>Most peer reviews shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. 15-20 minutes is probably normal. 
                    By all means - spend more time if you are really wanting a deeper understanding of the data/request. </li>
                <li>Feel free to peer review even if someone else called it (if you have time). However, try not to duplicate efforts.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <br>
        <h5><u>Example of a peer review email.</u></h5>
